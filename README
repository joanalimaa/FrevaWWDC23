# Freva - WWDC Scholarship Application [Accepted]

The Swift Playgound App was created for <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc22/swift-student-challenge/">WWDDC22 Swift Student Challenge</a>

## About the projectg

In this application, a character inspired by me teaches about the history of Frevo, its characteristics, etc. and at the end it shows some simple "passos" through animations. 
The application also has a narration, with the aim of being more accessible and teaching a few words in Portuguese, since the target audience is non-speakers of that language.
